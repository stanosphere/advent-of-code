# Advent Of Code

Advent of code solutions written in Haskell.

## Running Haskell Stuff
- do `stack build`
- do `stack ghci`
- go to the place where your file is (e.g. `:cd src/main/haskell/adventOfCode/2020/`)
- load your file (e.g. `:l Day4`)
- run your command (e.g. `part1`)
- make sure you have your puzzle input under "fixtures", I've git ignored those folders

Happy Haskelling my future self!
